            <p>Cozy games have a special place in my heart—the kind of games that make you <b>forget the real world for a while</b>.
                Whether I’m farming, fishing, decorating, or just hanging out with NPCs, these games become part of my daily routine.
                Sometimes I wake up excited just to check on my virtual crops or see what the shop’s selling today.
            </p>
            <p>Here is where I’ll share my thoughts on the games that help me <b>unwind and feel at home</b>.</p>
        </section>

        <h1>Stardew Valley</h1>
        <p>Start a new life in a quiet town—farm, fish, make friends, and maybe fall in love. It’s the ultimate escape from reality.</p>

            <p>I finally gave in to the hype and picked this up on sale for my Nintendo Switch—perfect for cozy gaming while lying in bed.
                At first, I thought it was just a simple farming simulator, but I quickly got hooked. The real charm of this game is in the
                townspeople: I loved chatting with them, giving them gifts, and slowly building relationships. Hailey ended up being my
                favourite—she’s a bit mean at first, but once you get to know her, she has a really sweet side.
            </p>
            <p>Some fun things you can do include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Farm crops and raise animals</li>
                <li>Fish in rivers, lakes, and the ocean</li>
                <li>Befriend and romance townspeople</li>
                <li>Decorate your home and farm</li>
                <li>Explore mines and fight monsters</li>
                <li>Discover secrets and seasonal events</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There’s so much more to this game than I expected: uncovering secrets, unlocking character cutscenes, levelling up skills,
                and exploring all the little mysteries around the valley. My only complaint is that the in-game days move way too fast—it
                can get stressful when all you want is a slow, relaxing time. I also wish there was more character customization like
                changing outfits and hairstyles whenever. But overall, it’s an easy and super fun game to get into, especially for beginners.
                I totally recommend!

        <h1>Animal Crossing</h1>
        <p>Build your dream island, befriend adorable villagers, and let real-time days pass in peaceful bliss. It's cozy, cute, and totally addicting.</p>

            <p>This was one of the first cozy games I ever played, and I was completely addicted during the pandemic lockdown.
                I used to wake up at 7 a.m. just to check the shops and change my outfit—it felt like a part of my daily routine.
                I eventually drifted away from it, but I played for a long time and really loved it while it lasted.
            </p>
            <p>Here's some things you can do in the game:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decorate and customize your island</li>
                <li>Design your house and character outfits</li>
                <li>Collect bugs, fish, fossils, and furniture</li>
                <li>Chat and bond with villagers</li>
                <li>Visit friends’ islands online</li>
                <li>Enjoy seasonal events and holidays</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The villagers are all so cute, though I wish you could interact with them in more meaningful ways. I loved the character
                customization and how you could change your look anytime. The real-time day cycle was such a cool feature—it made the world
                feel alive, even if it was sometimes frustrating when shops were closed at night. Still, it made me excited to come back
                the next day. Overall, it’s such a fun and wholesome game, and I would say worth the money.
