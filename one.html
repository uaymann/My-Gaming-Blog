            <p>Story-driven games have quickly become my favourite genre. As someone who already loves binge-watching shows and movies,
                <b>stepping into a game and playing as a character in the story</b>—feeling their fear, joy, heartbreak, and making tough choices
                for them—has been an unforgettable experience.
            </p>
            <p>Here, I’ll share my thoughts on every narrative game I’ve played once I’ve finished it, but beware, <b>spoilers ahead!</b>
                I’m currently playing through <i>The Last of Us Part II</i>—stay tuned!
            </p>

        <h1>Life is Strange Series</h1>
        <p>An emotional rollercoaster of choices, relationships, supernatural abilities, and teen drama—this series pulls you into
            the lives of its characters and I, personally, never want to leave.
        </p>

        <h2>Life is Strange</h2>
        <p>Step into Max’s shoes as she discovers her ability to rewind time and tries to fix the past, one difficult choice at a time.</p>

        <section class="intro">
            <p>I loved the story of this game. In <i>Life is Strange</i>, You play as Max, a photography student who returns to her hometown, Arcadia Bay,
                after five years away. While sitting in class, she has a realistic dream of a massive hurricane destroying the whole town
                and soon discovers she has the power to rewind time. Teaming up with her childhood friend Chloe, the two try to solve the
                mystery of Rachel Amber’s disappearance while also figuring out how to stop the coming storm.
            </p>
            <p>While the story felt a bit slow at times and some tasks—like the bottle hunt in the junkyard—were frustrating,
                the emotional weight of the story really pulled me in. The ending truly stayed with me. <b>Spoiler coming up ahead!</b>
                Personally, I think sacrificing Chloe makes more narrative sense—even though it’s heartbreaking. During the whole game,
                Max seems to be postponing her fate, and it feels wrong to let the whole town be destroyed just to save one person,
                no matter how much you love her. That said, I totally understand why others choose Chloe—the connection between her and
                Max is powerful and real. Both endings hurt in their own ways, but I usually prefer the sad ones, so sacrificing Chloe
                hit the hardest—and stuck with me the longest.

        <h2>Life is Strange 2</h2>
        <p>A powerful story of two brothers on the run, navigating life, loss, and the bond that holds them together—your choices shape their journey.</p>
        <figure class="image-container">

        <section class="intro">
            <p>This one hit even harder for me than the first game. In <i>Life is Strange 2</i>, You play as Sean, a teenager whose life is turned upside down after
                his father is killed in a police incident. He’s forced to flee with his younger brother Daniel, who soon discovers he has
                telekinetic powers. I loved how this game flipped the formula—you don't have powers yourself, but your choices guide Daniel,
                shaping who he becomes. That responsibility felt heavy but meaningful, making the choices even harder to make, especially
                since there’s no rewinding this time!
            </p>
            <p>The story didn’t drag at all for me; I was invested from start to finish and cried more than once. The sibling bond is
                incredibly well-written. I loved Daniel like he was my own little brother, and making decisions that affected both of them
                was tough. The game also dives into real-world themes like racism and discrimination and features a diverse cast of
                characters. With four major endings, each one emotional and bittersweet (except that one ending we don't speak of),
                this game broke my heart in the best way. One of my absolute favourites—I recommend it to everyone.

        <h1>Detroit: Become Human</h1>
        <p>What does it mean to be human? In this branching narrative, you control androids fighting for freedom in an eerie near-future world.</p>

        <section class="intro">
            <p>This game is what got me into narrative-driven games in the first place. In <i>Detroit: Become Human</i>, You play as three different androids—Connor,
                Kara, and Markus—whose stories eventually intertwine in a world where androids are rising up for their freedom.
                The branching storylines are incredibly detailed; I’ve played through it multiple times and still haven’t seen everything.
            </p>
            <p>The choices you make really matter, leading to drastically different outcomes. It’s philosophical, emotional, and full of
                tension. I appreciated that it gives you the option to focus on the story with easier gameplay or challenge yourself more
                if you prefer. That made it really beginner-friendly and accessible. It's one of the most intricate and replayable games
                I’ve played—definitely a top favourite for me.

        <h1>The Last of Us Part I</h1>
        <p>A haunting, cinematic journey through a post-apocalyptic world that tackles love, survival, and loss in a way that keeps you up at night.</p>
        <figure class="image-container">

        <section class="intro">
            <p>In <i>The Last of Us Part I</i>, you play mainly as Joel, occasionally as Ellie, navigating a post-apocalyptic world where a fungal
                outbreak has destroyed civilization. Ellie is immune, and your mission is to get her to a resistance group trying to
                create a cure. The bond between Joel and Ellie is the heart of the story, and it’s both beautiful and tragic.
            </p>
            <p>I played the game after watching the show, which I slightly regret because I already knew the plot. Still, the game was an
                amazing experience. The world is terrifying—between infected creatures and desperate humans, survival is a constant struggle.
                The difficulty was intense at times, but I appreciated the adjustable difficulty settings, which let me focus more on the
                story than on combat. The graphics were stunning and the emotional storytelling was unforgettable. I recommend it even for
                beginners—it’s worth every moment.
